For Task 5, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python in Google Colab. I began by loading and examining the dataset to understand its structure and identify missing values. Using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I created various visualizations including histograms, boxplots, countplots, pairplots, and a correlation heatmap to explore relationships between features such as age, fare, passenger class, gender, and survival. I analyzed patterns and trends, such as the higher survival rate among females and first-class passengers, and observed correlations between fare and survival. I also summarized the insights gained from the visuals and highlighted key observations as part of the final report.
